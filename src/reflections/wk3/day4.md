# What problems does the Observer Pattern seek to solve?
> It develops event drive data binding 
# What are the three mechanisms of the observer pattern?
> The broadcaster, the subscribe and the unsubscribe
#  Review the code generated from the bcw-template and reflect on the proxy objects from yesterday, and your understanding of the observer pattern today. With this knowledge, explain how the magic of the bcw-template uses these two concepts to manage and update the dom.
> The bcw template utilizes the broadcast method to have one function to an on event action without having to have multiple functions everywhere doing the same thing. Essentially it just organizes the code
