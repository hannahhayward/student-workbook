# What are the three states of a Promise?
>A promise always starts in the pending state, then can either be resolved and completed, or rejected/failed
#How do promises seek to resolve the issues of "callback hell"?
>Promises allow you to get a temporary immediate response from an asynchronous function and make it possible to chain multiple callbacks
# What is the difference between .then() and .catch()?
>.then() is what will happen if the promise is resolved, which will call the next area of code. .catch() is what happens if the promise is rejected, alerting you that the promise did not follow through
