# What are the three main types of testing we can accomplish in Vue? What does each method provide?
> unit testing, component testing, and end to end testing. unit testing tests each unit of code, component testing tests components and thier code as a whole, and end to end tests check both your front and back end.
# What testing method do you think is the most useful? Why?
> in my opinion i think that end to end testing is the most important. while the others do have a large significance, ensuring that your back and front end are performing properly is imperative. 
# What testing method do you think is the least useful? Why?
> I would have to say that unit testing is the least important, in my opinion. The component testing essentially does the same thing, just on a larger scale. With the appropriate debugging skills, you should be able to solve the issues relatively quickly. Otherwise, it seems quite redundant.
