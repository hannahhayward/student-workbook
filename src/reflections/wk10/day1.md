# What are the three categories of data types? How are they different?
> Value type, reference type and pointer type. A value type stores its value in memory, while a reference type references a different location for the data. A pointer is used within the reference type to point where the memory data is being stored.
# What are the Value-type data types? What differences do you notice from JavaScript?
> Some of the value type data types include booleans, decimals, integers, floats and chars. It is very similar to what javascript uses as their number type is a floating number, and we use booleans and integers (numbers) in both languages.
# In your own words, how do Reference types get stored in memory? How does this differ from Value types?
> A reference type does not store its own data, instead refers you to the location where you can find the data you’re looking for. While a value data type stores data within the local memory, making it directly accessible rather than having to ‘dig’ for it.
