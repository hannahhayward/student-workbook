# Why is good design important and what are some techniques?
>First impressions are everything. People often judge a companyâ€™s legitimacy by the website associated with it. A visually unattractive website can not only reduce traffic, but also reduce time spent viewing the site. With some tricks, keeping a clean, appealing, and interesting design is quite simple to create without a web designer. For example, the use of font color and weight is an excellent way to create a hierarchy of text without using an excessive amount of font sizes. In addition to changing the color, you can utilize opacity to establish hierarchy as well. Websites such as Amazon.com, Facebook.com, Etsy.com, and Google.com are excellent referrals to use when seeking design inspiration. All designs retain a style relatively unique to their page, while retaining a polished and user-friendly appearance.
