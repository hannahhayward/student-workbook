#During this final checkpoint simply journal your progress as you build the app. What have you achieved so far, what are you working on now, and what roadblocks are you currently overcoming. Feel free to take this time to express how you are feeling now at the end of the course, reflecting on everything you have learned so far.
> Today I feel like I've taken about four steps backwards. After reflecting, I've come to realize that my backtracking is my own fault. I pushed myself with setting some goals and rushed to get those done. As a result I ended up with plenty of dumb errors and bugs and now am cutting it wayyyy too close to the deadline. Learned my lesson for sure.
