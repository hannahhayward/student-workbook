>this weekend was a bit of a limbo for me. I struggled on friday but once I figured out the dumb mistake that was causing literally everything to break, I turned out to be much farther ahead than I thought I was. I also conqured the many to many relationship, which was something that I struggled with throughout the week. It was a big win for me.
