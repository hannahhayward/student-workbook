# Write a review and reflection of your experiences in this course, as this is the last lecture before your final project, what are your concerns, how do you plan to manage your time, what have you enjoyed most about the course up to this point.
> My experience throughout this course has been nothing short of wonderful. Despite the difficulties of the content, the staff has consistently had my back and provided the aid necessary for my success. Jake's lectures have been some of my favorite things to sit in on as well, as they're always packed with so much knowledge. I officially understand why all of the alumni talk about not wanting to leave this place. As for the final, I'm excited to test my abilities that I have (hopefully) acquired throughout the course, and put my new time management skills to use.
