# What is a List in C#?
> A list is a collection of objects, much like an array except we dont really use arrays in csharp.
# What List methods seem like you might use them often? Why?
> Add, clear, sort, remove and any of the find functions seem to be my first impression as the most used on a regular basis. 
# How would you retrieve an item from a list? What method could you use?
> There are multiple ways to retrieve a function from a list. You could find by id, which is the method that I most commonly use, as most objects have id’s. However, when not working with id’s, you could also use find, which looks for the first instance in which the object matches the predicate.
