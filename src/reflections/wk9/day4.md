# What is an Enum, and what are some use cases for them?
> an enum is a strongly typed constant that holds a value but remains symbolic. One case that you can use this is with creating a rock paper scissors console game, where you can use enums to signify the different moves available.
# How can you modify an Enum?
> you can modify the default starting number of an enum so it does not start at the integer of 0. You can do so my simple using an assignment operator when defining the enum.
# How have you used Enums in your afternoon lab projects this far?(if you have not yet, give an example of how you could)
>Before reading this article, I had not used enums. However, after learning the use of enums, I went back and redid our rock-paper-scissors project using enums. The project itself seemed to be much easier to create and organize using enums compared to dictionaries.
