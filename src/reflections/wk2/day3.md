# What are the main ways to write information to the console? Why/when should you use each style. 
> You can use your code document or print directly in the console log. Printing into the console log is a great way to take an in depth look at your code and how it's running and helps with the debugging process.
# Which tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS and how can this tab be useful when debugging HTML?
> The elements tab allows you to target each individual html element by either hovering over the visual display which then takes you to the section of code, or by finding the section in the code which will highlight that section of the page. This allows you to look at all the properties and see what is being applied and/or overridden, and allows you to make the appropriate edits and get immediate changes before altering your actual html doc
# Outside of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug your code?
> Using the debugging pane located in the source tab. It allows you to view and insert breakpoints and go through how each individual function performs. Another way to debug is simply using the debugger keyword in your actual code. This does essentially the same thing, but allows you to look at error codes thrown by your code rather than by your network.
