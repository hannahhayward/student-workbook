# What is scope and hoisting, and how does this affect your use of let, var and const?
>Scope defines where the variable will be available for use, while hoisting is a function that moves declared variables to the top of the scope before being executed. You would want to use var in the instance that you are wanting to update the declared value within a global scope. Let and const are used when looking at block scopes. Let would be used when wanting to redeclare a value within the block and const would be used when wanting to update the properties of the object within the block.
